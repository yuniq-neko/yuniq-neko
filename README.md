### Welcome to my GitHub Profile ðŸ˜®

Here you can find the many different things that I start to work on then forget about a week later... then suddenly finish 3 years later... [yuniq-neko/phonetic-html-js](https://github.com/yuniq-neko/phonetic-html-js/) is a perfect example of that...

Mainly specialise in 3D Printing & SBC devices like Arduino & RaspberryPi, but also do a fair bit of JavaScript, PowerShell & C++ coding/programming/scripting/whateveryouwannacallit.

I also run my own business specialising in 3D Printer Accessories, 3D Printing Services, Laser Cutting Services, and more! All based in Melbourne, Australia! You can visit it's website at [yuniq.tech](https://yuniq.tech/).
